# Novi Webshop (Starter)

Initial static website for Novi, a webshop focused on 3D printed products for children and parents.

## Current Scope

- Brand-forward landing page
- Temporary product collection cards
- About section and launch timeline placeholder
- Newsletter/updates signup UI
- Lightweight cart count interaction (frontend demo only)
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Files

- `index.html` - page structure and content
- `styles.css` - visual style, layout, motion, responsive behavior
- `script.js` - small interactions (cart badge + footer year)

## Run Locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve with:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080`.
